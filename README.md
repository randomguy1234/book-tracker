# Book Tracker

## Description
The purpose of this project is to convert an already existing RESTful API 
application into an application that makes use of React to create a better 
front-end and create a full stack MERN application. The original owner 
created a book website where the user can search fo up to 10 books, login, 
and save searched books, and view them on a seperate page. This project will
be using Apollo and GraphQL to make the site more responsive because they
have a version that is compatabile with express.js.
